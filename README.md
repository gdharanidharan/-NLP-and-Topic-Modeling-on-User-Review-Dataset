## Overview
In this project, I used the K-means algorithm and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to cluster and find latent topics in the user review dataset. This data set includes reviews of a particular product from an e-commerce company. 

* Preprocessed review text by tokenization, stemming, removing stop words and extracted features by Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF)
* Trained unsupervised learning models of K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Analysis
* Identified latent topics and keywords of each review
* Visualized results by dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
